My writing habits are typically to sit down and take a large chunk of the evening or afternoon to write. I generally sit down and try and write the entire paper in one sitting. This usually takes anywhere from one-hour to several hours. When I do this, I usually go back the next day and read everything I  previously wrote and make adjustments as I see fit. This allows me time to get all my thoughts down on paper while I set aside a specific time where I only focus on that topic. It allows me to focus and to get involved with my thoughts. After I get all my thoughts down on paper, I can go back and revise and fix things I believe may be fuzzy. I write this way so I do not lose track of my thoughts and ideas for the paper. If I take short block times each day, I lose focus of the overall picture and forget the direction I am headed. 
On other bigger projects, I do take an alotted time out of each day to work on a specific section of the project. So I may decide to work on the intro one day, and the third body the next. This allows me time to take a break and re-focus on a fresh start the coming day. It allows me time to work so I do not feel so crammed to do everything at once. My mind can be clear for the section at hand so I am not just writing to get it done. 
One improvement I  could make would be to divide the sections/writings up more so I dont take such long chunks of my dauy to work. It is often hard to devote that much time in one day for only one assignment. If I divided it more, I could take several days and give myself shorter chunks to get it done. It would also allow me a fresh start and alleviate some stress from trying to cram everything in all at one time. 
One strength is that is does allow me more time to go back and edit. And it allows me to get the main idea out so I can focus more on the details.
