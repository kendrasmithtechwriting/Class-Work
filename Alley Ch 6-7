"Healthy soil can improve crop and livestock production"

Analogy: Just as a computer needs an operating system, crops and livestock need healthy soil. Without the operating system, the computer could not run and woul be potentially useless. Without healthy soil, the crops would not grow and flourish and the livestock would have no food to eat; resulting in little to no crop production or livestock reproduction.
