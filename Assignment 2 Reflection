One thing I learned was that GitHub is very complex and you cannot create a GitHub pages without downloading a program. I learned that blog's can be very useful and informational, but they can be time consuming. Also that it is probably way more practical to use a traditional blogging website unless you are very into computer programming and software. I learned how to gather information efficiently and effectively while keeping an end goal and focus in mind. 

One thing I'm still unsure of is how to create links that will show up as links on the website. I made the thinks that will show up as hyperlinks on my github repository when you view the file, but once you get to the actual website, the just show up as types links and won't allow you to click on them. This is particularly frustrating that it's showing up correctly in the github repository when you view the file, but the actual website through github is not showing what the repository on github is showing.
